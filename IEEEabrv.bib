% USAGE:
% 
% \bibliographystyle{mybstfile} 
% \bibliography{IEEEabrv,mybibfile}
%
% where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
% defined here. e.g.,
%
%
%    journal = IEEE_J_AC,
%
%
% to yield "{IEEE} Trans. Automat. Contr."
%
%
% IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies -
% this file is suitable for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.
%
%
% For work that requires full-length titles, you should use the full
% titles provided in the companion file, IEEEfull.bib.
%
%
% ** NOTES **
%
% 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
%    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
%    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
%    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.
%
% 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
% 
% 3. Abbreviations follow IEEE's style.
%
% 4. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
%    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).
%
% 5. The following NEW/current journal definitions have been disabled because
%    their abbreviations have not yet been finalized/verified:
%    
%    STRING{IEEE_J_MC         = "{IEEE} Trans. Mobile Comput."}
%    STRING{IEEE_J_JEM        = "{IEEE/TMS} J. Electron. Mater."}
%    STRING{IEEE_J_MCTE       = "{IEEE} Trans. Molecular Cellular Tissue Eng."}
%    STRING{IEEE_J_ESSL       = "{IEEE/ECS} Electrochemical Solid-State Lett."}
%    STRING{IEEE_J_CJECE      = "Canadian J. Elect. Comput. Eng."}
%    
% 6. The following OLD journal definitions have been disabled because
%    their abbreviations have not yet been found/verified:
%
%    STRING{IEEE_J_EWS        = "{IEEE} Trans. Eng. Writing Speech"}
%    STRING{IEEE_J_BCTV       = "{IEEE} Trans. Broadcast Television Receivers"}
%
% If you know what the proper abbreviation is for a string in #5 or #6 above,
% email me and I will correct them in the next release.
